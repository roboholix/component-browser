# Contributing

Until there is more traction to this project, things will be kept fairly informal. Requests
will be addressed as quickly as possible, but bear in mind for the moment this project
is maintained by "just one dude".

## Issue Labels

of the following labels:

## PR's (pull requests)

Please follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when submitting a PR.

If you would like to contribute I only ask if you would like to submit a PR to please keep 
the syntax in the same general "style" as the currently existing code. A formal styleguide 
will be added later. 

## Feature requests

Feature requests and suggestions are absolutely welcome, but please note I'll be putting 
off any new feature development until all critical bugs are addressed and this library
has moved out of "beta" development.
